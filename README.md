# UnetSegmentation

My own implementation of the U-net architecture compared to a pretrained model from PyTorch Segmentation Models.

To train:

```python -m src.train```

To visualize training:

```tesnorboard --logdir runs```

To visually compare models on some examples:

```python -m src.evaluate```
